# Media Watchlist

This project was based on personal preferences. I created a webiste using Django with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PostgreSQL. This was a set-up to my HTML & CSS Only Project where I included free APIs that stored upcoming movies and pre-existing media to create my personal watchlist and search for media to put on my "Watch Later" list.

***NOTE: a local host was used for PostgreSQL. If you want to see the final product, you would have to make sure do have PostgreSQL in your local machine and have the right migrations.***
